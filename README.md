**TagFlow** is a minimal UI application for tagging and organizing windows, tabs, and workspaces in the BSPWM window manager on Ubuntu Linux. It enables you to categorize your applications by project or context, and seamlessly manage them across your workflow.

## Overview

TagFlow allows you to assign tags like "project1", "project2", or "personal" to windows and workspaces, then manage these tagged elements efficiently. With simple commands, you can send all windows with a specific tag to their designated workspace, preview all windows belonging to a particular tag, and maintain organization across your BSPWM environment.

## Future Features

- [ ] Move tagged windows to their corresponding workspaces with a single command
